# Hello, I'm George!

I'm currently a Course Admin, Tutor and Undergraduate Computer Science Student @ UNSW. 🌱

I love a good CTF. 🚩

What gets me thinking the most is security and computer networks. With how connected all devices are, having a strong understanding of network security is extremely important to me. 🌐

One of my favourite optimisations for my various workflows is making use of CI/CD pipelines and automation. ⚙️

On the weekend I love to play sports such as Volleyball, Baseball, Football and Tennis. 🏐

Please feel free to reach out to me if you want to chat about any of this stuff, I love meeting new people!
