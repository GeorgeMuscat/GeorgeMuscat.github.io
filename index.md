# Hello, I'm George!

I'm currently a Security Engineering Consultant @ Asontu. 🌱

I love a good CTF with friends. 🚩

I'm particularly interested in combining the principles and techniques from Site Reliability Engineering and Security Engineering, as they are closely related and often mutually beneficial.

Lately, I've been spending a majority of my spare time messing with my homelab, where I run a variety of services for friends and family.

You can contact me at [george@muscat.sh](mailto:george@muscat.sh)
