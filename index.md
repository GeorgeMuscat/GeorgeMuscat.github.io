# Hello, I'm George!

I'm currently a Course Admin, Tutor and Undergraduate Computer Science Student @ UNSW. 🌱

What gets me thinking the most is security and computer networks. I wasn't always interested in networks, however as I have delved deeper in my studies, my appreciation for the power of networks has grown tremendously. 🌐

On the weekend I play volleyball, volleyball and more volleyball. 🏐

Also CTFs are pretty cool. 🚩
