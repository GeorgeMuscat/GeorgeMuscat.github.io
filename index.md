# Hello, I'm George!

I'm currently a Course Admin, Tutor and Undergraduate Computer Science Student @ UNSW. 🌱

I love a good CTF. 🚩

What gets me thinking the most is security and computer networks. With how connected all devices are, having a strong understanding of network security is extremely important to me. 🌐

On the weekend I love to play sports such as Volleyball, Baseball, Football and Tennis. 🏐
