# Hello, I'm George!

I'm currently a Security Engineering Consultant @ Asontu. 🌱

I love a good CTF with friends. 🚩

I'm particularly interested in combining the principles and techniques from Site Reliability Engineering and Security Engineering, as they are closely related and often mutually beneficial.

Lately, I have been dedicating time to mastering the full log lifecycle, experimenting with building systems that cover creation, secure transmission, storage, and efficient retrieval. Lately I've been building agents that collect and transmit logs using QUIC.

I have also been spending a bit of my spare time messing with my homelab, where I run a variety of services for friends and family.
